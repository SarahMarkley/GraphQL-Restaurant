Title: GraphQL Restaurant

Description: The GraphQL Restaurant data exercise shows how to accomplish tasks by implementing the methods under the "root" object. These tasks include getting a single restaurant based on a provided ID, getting a list of all restaurants, creating a new restaurant, deleting a restaurant based on the provided IF, and updating a restaurant based on the provided ID.

How to Run: In order to run the real time bus tracker, download index.js and package,json into the same directory. Once you download the files, please run npm install in the terminal. 

Roadmap of future improvements: In the future, it would be helpful to implement other methods under the "root" object.
